          I started coding in middle school on a TI-83+ SE graphing calculator. I taught myself the imperative programming paradigm and computer science principles without internet access, teachers, or books through the use of black-box reverse-engineering techniques.

          My first language was TI-BASIC, which has no lexical scoping for its variables, and I used the code editor on calculator, which shows only 16x8 characters, and has no commenting system. I produced a series of math programs to automate my school work, instead of doing the school work. My brother and I created text-based and graphical games like pong, snake, and 'guess da number' and found ways to cheat and break each others' games, like using the variable lookup key to circumvent guessing the number. I developed as a Reliability Analyst at ALSAC/St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, I bring a unique perspective to coding and problem-solving. I enjoy working with a variety of programming languages and technologies, and I'm always eager to learn more.
